My previous attempts in poetry had never made me satisfied, but with time I built a little more confidence. This feeling of \"how did I even think of that?\" became one of my most valued sensations in the world.</p>\n<p>The thing is, songwriting became a coping mechanism for most of my day-to-day problems and struggles. I found myself so caught up in the routine that I figured I needed to spend some time focusing on how I'm feeling. Instead of looking for someone else for therapy, I found my way of getting in touch with my emotions. Yes, it usually gets a little cliche and cringy, and I'm sorry about that.</p>\n<p>In this whole process, I have continuously revisited everything I wrote and would never stop \"improving\" the tiniest details. I needed to find a way to stick to a version of my ideas and this blog is my attempt to put an end to this perfectionist approach.</p>\n<p>In short, here I begin to do what we're always recommended not to do: I'll let all my insecurities exposed for anyone on the Internet to read them. Writing letters and poems can be quite therapeutical, but inevitably lead to nothing if I don't come forward to send them to their appropriate recipients. Well, at least I'll know that people could find them if they wanted to.</p>\n<p>These are my lyrics that most of the time don't come to me alongside convincing melodies, hence the blog title. These are my <strong>poems with choruses</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 09, 2019","path":"/self-titled","title":"Self-Titled","description":"After a long process of overthinking, worrying and postponing, I finally decided to begin this blog.","imageUrl":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
