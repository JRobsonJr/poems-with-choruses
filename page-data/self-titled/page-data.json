My previous attempts in poetry had never made me satisfied, but with time I built a little more confidence. This feeling of \"how did I even think of that?\" became one of my most valued sensations in the world.</p>\n<p>The thing is, songwriting became a coping mechanism for most of my day-to-day problems and struggles. I found myself so caught up in the routine that I figured I needed to spend some time focusing on how I'm feeling. Instead of looking for someone else for therapy, I found my way of getting in touch with my emotions. Yes, it usually gets a little cliche and cringy, and I'm sorry about that.</p>\n<p>In this whole process, I have continuously revisited everything I wrote and would never stop \"improving\" the tiniest details. I needed to find a way to stick to a version of my ideas and this blog is my attempt to put an end to this perfectionist approach.</p>\n<p>In short, here I begin to do what we're always recommended not to do: I'll let all my insecurities exposed for anyone on the Internet to read them. Writing letters and poems can be quite therapeutical, but inevitably lead to nothing if I don't come forward to send them to their appropriate recipients. Well, at least I'll know that people could find them if they wanted to.</p>\n<p>These are my lyrics that most of the time don't come to me alongside convincing melodies, hence the blog title. These are my <strong>poems with choruses</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 09, 2019","path":"/self-titled","title":"Self-Titled","description":"After a long process of overthinking, worrying and postponing, I finally decided to begin this blog.","imageUrl":null,"lang":null,"series":null,"prev":null,"next":null}}},"pageContext":{"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt"],"messages":{"title":"Poems With Choruses","description":"Documenting life as I try to fit it in the lyrics of a song.","author":"Robson Junior","obsession-history":"Obsession History","home":"Home","previous":"Previous","next":"Next","read":"Read","current-obsession":"Current obsession","prologue":"Prologue","playlist-cta":"Check out the album-inspired playlist","by":"by","locale-switcher":"🇧🇷","language-cta":"🇧🇷 Leia a versão em português!","not-found":"Page not found","concurrent-access.title":"Concurrent Access","concurrent-access.side-a":"Side A: Race Conditions","concurrent-access.side-b":"Side B: Starvation","concurrent-access.side-c":"Side C: No Preemption","concurrent-access.track-1":"Faith-Seeker","concurrent-access.track-2":"All That Takes","concurrent-access.track-3":"Worthy","concurrent-access.track-4":"Empty Corridors","concurrent-access.track-5":"Say We Did It (The Comfort Out of the Blue)","concurrent-access.track-6":"Overwrite","concurrent-access.track-7":"If It Happens At All","concurrent-access.track-8":"Go-To Me","concurrent-access.track-9":"YDWML!","concurrent-access.track-10":"Better Keep My Hopes","concurrent-access.track-11":"In Case You Ever Listen","concurrent-access.track-12":"Now We’re Talking","concurrent-access.track-13":"Need You Back","concurrent-access.track-14":"...Don’t You?","concurrent-access.track-15":"Revoked Access"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/self-titled","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
