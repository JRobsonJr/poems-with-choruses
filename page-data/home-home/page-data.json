It reminds me to be grateful for everything I have and for every battle that has shaped me.</p>\n<p>I think \"Home, Home\" sums a lot of the reflections that this day calls for. I wrote this one out of the nostalgia <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6eQ3H5tlCt8EkAXH6Tk0Ez?si=TtyRAq7CRVOaSQh3uFdb4A\">Home</a> from the Undertale soundtrack evokes on me. Thank you, Toby.
