I was hopeful that I could be a little closer to a lifelong dream, and thinking about how so many people lead the everyday life I so long hoped for, but they took it for granted.</p>\n<p>Now, with everything that's going on, even dreaming of it sometimes feels like a stretch. \"Simpler\" goals and things that <strong>I</strong> took for granted seem so much more desirable: to be able to go outside without fearing the worse for everyone around me, to be able to see my friends, to wake up early in the morning, to wait half an hour for the next bus. Now, I'm well aware that the streets I always walked through are easily New York streets for other people â€” these days, even for me.</p>\n<p>And this might not look like it, but it's still a love song. A love song dedicated to dreaming, a love song dedicated to the friends I want to share it with. A love song for getting back on the streets as soon as possible and keep working to achieve the dream.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>New York Streets</em></strong></p>\n<p>New York streets, I watch you through my TV <br>\n'Cause someday I'm gonna walk you down <br>\nNew York streets, can you even hear me? <br>\nA dream of you is always a dream out loud</p>\n<p>New York streets, they call you irritating <br>\nStuck in traffic, trying to walk you down <br>\nBut I'd match my heartbeat with this longing <br>\nTo learn you well enough to get around</p>\n<p><strong>How can you ever take for granted <br>\nWalking down New York streets? <br>\nHow can you ever take for granted <br>\nPlaces I only ever see in my sleep?</strong></p>\n<p>New York streets have never been so empty <br>\nBut someday, I'm gonna walk them down <br>\nOnce everything is settled, it's still my one goal <br>\nTicking every checkbox on my way out</p>\n<p><strong>How can you ever take for granted <br>\nWalking down New York streets? <br>\nHow can you ever take for granted <br>\nPlaces I only ever see in my sleep? <br>\nI confess that life here is comfortable <br>\nThat maybe I live someone else's dream <br>\nI admit to forgetting to be grateful <br>\nBut I wouldn't overlook New York streets</strong></p>\n<p>New York streets, I'm ready when you let me <br>\nCloser and closer so I can walk you down <br>\nI'll cry some days, it's been a long time coming <br>\nI'll befriend the street lights that I find in town <br>\nBe proud with me, when the day arrives <br>\nI'll be proud to get to walk you down</p>\n<p><strong>How can you ever take for granted <br>\nWalking down New York streets? <br>\nHow can you ever take for granted <br>\nPlaces I only ever see in my sleep? <br>\nI confess that life here is comfortable <br>\nThat maybe I live someone else's dream <br>\nI admit to forgetting to be grateful <br>\nBut I wouldn't overlook New York streets</strong></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2020","path":"/new-york-streets","title":"Quarantine Diaries: New York Streets","description":"Ticking every checkbox on my way out.","imageUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/wiBAkdw.png","lang":null,"series":null,"prev":null,"next":null}}},"pageContext":{"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt"],"messages":{"title":"Poems With Choruses","description":"Documenting life as I try to fit it in the lyrics of a song.","author":"Robson Junior","obsession-history":"Obsession History","home":"Home","previous":"Previous","next":"Next","read":"Read","current-obsession":"Current obsession","prologue":"Prologue","playlist-cta":"Check out the album-inspired playlist","by":"by","locale-switcher":"ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·","language-cta":"ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Leia a versÃ£o em portuguÃªs!","not-found":"Page not found","concurrent-access.title":"Concurrent Access","concurrent-access.side-a":"Side A: Race Conditions","concurrent-access.side-b":"Side B: Starvation","concurrent-access.side-c":"Side C: No Preemption","concurrent-access.track-1":"Faith-Seeker","concurrent-access.track-2":"All That Takes","concurrent-access.track-3":"Worthy","concurrent-access.track-4":"Empty Corridors","concurrent-access.track-5":"Say We Did It (The Comfort Out of the Blue)","concurrent-access.track-6":"Overwrite","concurrent-access.track-7":"If It Happens At All","concurrent-access.track-8":"Go-To Me","concurrent-access.track-9":"YDWML!","concurrent-access.track-10":"Better Keep My Hopes","concurrent-access.track-11":"In Case You Ever Listen","concurrent-access.track-12":"Now Weâ€™re Talking","concurrent-access.track-13":"Need You Back","concurrent-access.track-14":"...Donâ€™t You?","concurrent-access.track-15":"Revoked Access"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/new-york-streets","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
