Ever since I started writing, I wanted to create something to sum up my whole year in some way. At 18, I wrote that I wouldn't act my age, but I was still far from the truth. At 19, I wrote about meeting someone to make me feel complete, but I ended up learning I needed to know myself better instead.</p>\n<p>Past these experiences, at 20, I wrote about the in-between. I wrote about how it's hard to practice the \"I won't act my age\" maxim when there's a lot of pressure from society that you internalize, and that the feeling of completeness doesn't come from other people except yourself (which is another maxim in itself). And as much as the overthinker in me would like to say this is my ultimate perspective on life, I'm in love with the fact that I'm probably wrong.</p>\n<p>It came out all at once, September 6th.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Checkboxes</em></strong></p>\n<p>I was painted in naivety against my will <br>\nAnd since I was born <br>\nI thought of things as they weren’t <br>\nI believed in what isn’t real <br>\nAnd questioned if I’m watched from above <br>\nAs far back as I can remember, at least twice a day<br>\nI stress over what I don’t know</p>\n<p><strong>‘Cause if I ever decide to let anyone in <br>\nThey’ll expect me to be someone that I still can’t <br>\nAnd if you think like everyone else <br>\nFor you, my experience checkboxes <br>\nDon’t meet the preconditions to reach twenty <br>\nBut hey, I should respect my rhythm <br>\nOr my lack of it thereof <br>\nIf I find someone who thinks the same as me <br>\nThey’ll respect that I can’t be as they thought <br>\nIn my bones, I still hope, I’m enough</strong></p>\n<p>I painted myself in honesty when I couldn’t sit still <br>\n‘Cause since I was born <br>\nI had a lot stuck that I needed to let out <br>\nNow I’m considering a new life ahead <br>\nStill daydreaming a lot, still swearing in thoughts <br>\nI always stress over what I don’t know <br>\nAnd I don’t know how long I won’t <br>\nBut until I do</p>\n<p><strong>If you expect anything from me <br>\nI’m sorry, I still can’t <br>\nIf you think like everyone else <br>\nFor you, my experience checkboxes <br>\nDon’t meet the preconditions to reach twenty <br>\nBut hey, I should respect my rhythm <br>\nOr my lack of it thereof <br>\nIf I find someone who thinks the same as me <br>\nThey’ll respect that I can’t be as they thought <br>\nIn my bones, I still hope, I’m enough</strong></p>\n<p>And I could scream from the rooftops <br>\n\"I won’t act my age!\" <br>\nBut that would never be enough <br>\nI could fight my desires and pretend I don’t care <br>\nBut I’ve been there, it’s too rough <br>\nI could try to forget him and move on unaffected <br>\nBut I’m not so tough <br>\nIn my bones, I still hope, I’m enough</p>\n<p><strong>‘Cause if I ever decide to let anyone in <br>\nThey’ll expect me to be someone that I still can’t <br>\nAnd if you think like everyone else <br>\nFor you, my experience checkboxes <br>\nDon’t meet the preconditions to reach twenty <br>\nBut hey, I should respect my rhythm <br>\nOr my lack of it thereof <br>\nIf I find someone who thinks the same as me <br>\nThey’ll respect that I can’t be as they thought <br>\nIn my bones, I still hope, I’m enough</strong></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 08, 2019","path":"/checkboxes","title":"Checkboxes","description":"Still daydreaming a lot, still swearing in thoughts.","imageUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/PI1FgP1.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
