Simple words, right? But it's hard to love someone who sabotages all your real moments. The person who can't focus on losing the extra weight. The one that doesn't believe you're ever worthy of being loved.</p>\n<p>So I need to \"rehearse and repeat it,\" as taught by Dua Lipa, or \"fake it until you make it,\" the words in the mindset of everyone who aims to build confidence from nothing.</p>\n<p>Rephrasing and adding my twist, maybe I facilitate some people's way to my feelings. Therefore, when I need to find recovery, I have to decide to revoke this access.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Revoked Access</em></strong></p>\n<p>I ruined my day again <br>\nWith these obsessions <br>\nI wrecked my faith <br>\nGuess I'll never learn my lesson <br>\nCan't claim coincidence to spare me <br>\nIf there was a threshold of repeated mistakes <br>\nI'd be much over it</p>\n<p>The thing I'm trying to get into my head <br>\nIt's been discussed before <br>\nBut sometimes I'd rather have him than have to believe</p>\n<p><strong>You can't commit to loving <br>\nIf you don't love yourself <br>\nNow that I know myself better <br>\nI know I needed something else</strong></p>\n<p>I drove myself crazy again <br>\nCraving someone's touch <br>\nI sabotaged a good moment <br>\nLetting bitter nothings in my ear <br>\nDisconnect me from the conversation <br>\nI'm watching my back all night <br>\nStuck in a feeling that won't disappear</p>\n<p>The thing I'm trying to get into my head <br>\nTo make up for the lost time <br>\nSometimes I'd rather have him, even if he'd rather leave</p>\n<p><strong>You can't commit to loving <br>\nIf you don't love yourself <br>\nNow that I know myself better <br>\nI know I needed something else</strong></p>\n<p>Know too well the sources <br>\nThat can hurt me deeply <br>\nKept me in the dark so long <br>\nLeft to pick up the pieces <br>\nStill, the alternate path I face <br>\nNever lead me to dead ends <br>\nI guess fate is going ahead <br>\nMe and my good friend <br>\nTo the core, both faith-seekers</p>\n<p><strong>You can't commit to loving <br>\nIf you don't love yourself <br>\nNow that I know myself better <br>\nI know I needed something else</strong></p>\n<p>Tired of letting everything rewrite me <br>\nOne day I made the choice <br>\nI decided to revoke the access <br>\nTo manage only the good spirits <br>\nI needed to revoke the access <br>\nMaintain my feelings off-limits <br>\nTo anyone but to myself</p>\n<p><strong>You can't commit to loving <br>\nIf you don't love yourself <br>\nNow that I know myself better <br>\nI know I needed something else <br>\nSo I'm revoking the access</strong></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 29, 2020","path":"/revoked-access","title":"Revoked Access","description":"One day I made the choice.","imageUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/Lr42IgA.jpg","lang":null,"series":"Concurrent Access","prev":"/dont-you","next":null}}},"pageContext":{"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt"],"messages":{"title":"Poems With Choruses","description":"Documenting life as I try to fit it in the lyrics of a song.","author":"Robson Junior","obsession-history":"Obsession History","home":"Home","previous":"Previous","next":"Next","read":"Read","current-obsession":"Current obsession","prologue":"Prologue","playlist-cta":"Check out the album-inspired playlist","by":"by","locale-switcher":"ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·","language-cta":"ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Leia a versÃ£o em portuguÃªs!","not-found":"Page not found","concurrent-access.title":"Concurrent Access","concurrent-access.side-a":"Side A: Race Conditions","concurrent-access.side-b":"Side B: Starvation","concurrent-access.side-c":"Side C: No Preemption","concurrent-access.track-1":"Faith-Seeker","concurrent-access.track-2":"All That Takes","concurrent-access.track-3":"Worthy","concurrent-access.track-4":"Empty Corridors","concurrent-access.track-5":"Say We Did It (The Comfort Out of the Blue)","concurrent-access.track-6":"Overwrite","concurrent-access.track-7":"If It Happens At All","concurrent-access.track-8":"Go-To Me","concurrent-access.track-9":"YDWML!","concurrent-access.track-10":"Better Keep My Hopes","concurrent-access.track-11":"In Case You Ever Listen","concurrent-access.track-12":"Now Weâ€™re Talking","concurrent-access.track-13":"Need You Back","concurrent-access.track-14":"...Donâ€™t You?","concurrent-access.track-15":"Revoked Access"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/revoked-access","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
