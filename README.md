# Poems With Choruses

_Poems With Choruses_ is a personal project. I write as an emotional release and store the final versions here so that I'm not tempted to rewrite them over and over. [The first post](https://jrobsonjr.github.io/poems-with-choruses/self-titled) might be more enlightening as to the full purpose of this.

## Technically speaking

This is a Gatsby project and basically all configuration needed to serve it locally is to clone the repository, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies and then `yarn start`.
