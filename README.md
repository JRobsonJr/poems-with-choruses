# Poems With Choruses

_Poems With Choruses_ is a personal project. I write as an emotional release and store the final versions here so that I'm not tempted to rewrite them over and over. [The first post](https://jrobsonjr.github.io/poems-with-choruses/self-titled) might be more enlightening as to the full purpose of this.

If you got here somehow, feel free to read! But I'll never really know you were here since I've yet to implement features related to interactions. What a bummer, I know...

## Technically speaking

This is a Gatsby project and basically all configuration needed to serve it locally is to clone the repository, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies and then `yarn start`.
