> **_Say We Did It (The Comfort Out of the Blue)_**
>
> When my truth hit hard \
> Shattering the foundations of the deepest lie \
> A journey for one to face solo \
> Anybody else would've looked the other way \
> But you held on tighter \
> Helped make the situation feel a little lighter \
> Even before that, I already knew \
> I had found a one of a kind when I met you \
> Try to keep that in mind \
> As the trickiest part still needed to come out \
> I could seek the right moment \
> But I'm inclined to think that this concept is a myth of time \
> Realizations will get tough \
> And the world isn't fair enough to let you catch your breath
>
> I think I picked up a bad habit \
> You made me forget how to be alone \
> But there's no escape, no other way around it \
> This time I'll have to do it on my own
>
> **You deserve better than the things I could've faked \
> And I'd never let us do anything just to say we did \
> As I hold back tears on the way home \
> Thinking of what I'm about to do \
> I'm hit by relief out of the blue \
> It's the comfort I'll find in never lying again to you**
>
> My mistakes are clear now \
> Mostly silent grudges that I regret not talking out \
> My attitude wasn't the best \
> I admit to overthinking when I should've let it rest \
> I'm quite the challenge \
> Always figuring out that I don't know myself yet \
> You're part of my path \
> And I'll keep trying to \
> But I won't be able to express how grateful I am
>

> It's the comfort I'll find in never lying again to you**
>
> I'll keep playing the songs we shared \
> Going down the ways we went \
> And I'll be remembering your tenderness \
> The waiting, the patience \
> The honesty, the conversations \
> And the very moment that I'll replay \
> The embrace that preceded it, so tight it hurt \
> But not as much as knowing I'd let you slip away

> Remember what I told you \
> What I treasure the most \
> Is that you're my best friend \
> Remember what I wrote \
> Whatever I know, I'll share with you \
> Whatever you can teach me \
> I'll do my best to learn \
> And whatever we don't know \
> We'll figure out together
