> [Versão em português: 21 lições antes dos 21](21-lessons-pt)

Around a year ago, Taylor Swift shared [30 things she learned before turning 30](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26628467/taylor-swift-30th-birthday-lessons/). Back then, I was about to celebrate my twentieth birthday, so it was the perfect opportunity to write my version of that... Except I didn't finish it in time. Now that I'm turning 21, which is not as symbolic as either 20 or 30 seems to be, I suddenly felt the urge to complete this task for the year. Here's my twist: I present 21 songs with lessons that I am actively trying to pursue in life, not things that I'm fully practicing yet. So maybe "21 goals" might be more on point than saying these are lessons I've learned.

Here's the playlist to listen while you're reading:

### 1. Don't be scared of dreaming

> And we become night time dreamers \
> Street walkers, small talkers \
> When we should be daydreamers \
> And moonwalkers and dream talkers \
> In real life \
> **— _Daydreamer_, AURORA**

We get older and tend to become focused on results, on short-term life objectives. But dreams shouldn't be limited to the images our brains project while we're sleeping: we should allow ourselves to have high hopes and nonconforming minds. Aim to change the world, even if it seems impossible.

### 2. It's never too late to start

> You say too late to start \
> With your heart in a headlock \
> You know you're better than this \
> **— _Headlock_, Imogen Heap**

It's all about believing there's still time to learn something new or to begin something you always wanted to do. Past experiences can haunt us and turn us into preys of self-disbelief that things might work when they didn't before, but a dream never stops being worth pursuing.

### 3. There's no such "perfect moment" for anything

> If you got something to say, say it right away \
> If you got something to do, do what's right for you \
> If you got somebody to love, give that love today \
> Know you got nothing to lose, there's no time to waste \
> If you got a letter for me, send it right away \
> If you know that you really care, don't hold your breath \
> **— _Send to Robin Immediately_, Robyn**

If I were to write about the feelings I nurtured for years before confessing them, I'd be writing an article at least ten times the length of this list. If someone hurts you, or if you love someone, tell them immediately. In a safer approach, find a balance between being protective of yourself and being bold.

### 4. Self-love comes first

> If I could make you love me \
> Maybe you could make me love me \
> And if I can't make you love me \
> Then I'll just hate everybody \
> **— _I HATE EVERYBODY_, Halsey**

As Halsey herself said, these lyrics are "not advice." Instead, they are almost mockingly denouncing everything wrong with going headfirst into love without loving yourself first. It places you in the space of need for others' acceptance before you find your own when it should be the other way around.

### 5. Forgive and apologize

> We just pick up, pick up and start again \
> 'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges \
> **— _Grudges_, Paramore**

I thought holding grudges wasn't a problem for me until I started paying attention to daily life situations that caused me discomfort. Instead of talking it out, I would hold those feelings in until they were too much, until I exploded. It's liberating to understand it's not fair nor healthy to revisit people's mistakes in your head when they didn't intend to do you wrong.

### 6. Face relationship adversities head-on

> So don't brush it under the rug \
> 'Cause when we get through the struggle \
> That's when we level up \
> **— _Level Up_, Sigrid**

On the same note of not holding grudges, you won't ever grow in a relationship if you're not willing to face the confrontations and have the tough conversations when they become needed.

### 7. Treat people with kindness

> Maybe we can find a place to feel good \
> And we can treat people with kindness \
> **— _Treat People With Kindness_, Harry Styles**

There are no two ways around this one — the title is self-explanatory.

### 8. Don't let go of naivety completely

> I would rather see this world through the eyes of a child \
> **— _Through the Eyes of a Child_, AURORA**

It's simple: grow up, but don't dismiss the kid inside. Learn to be mature, but don't be afraid to see the good in the world.

### 9. Your past doesn't define your future

> The past can't haunt me if I don't let it \
> Live and learn and never forget it \
> Whoa, gotta learn to let it go \
> **— _Learn to Let Go_, Kesha**

Kesha didn't go easy on us with "it's time to practice what I preach." It's easy to say that you should move on from the bad experiences, but if you're stuck regretting past decisions, you can't go on with life without overthinking every move.

### 10. Time... heals

> Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn \
> Just how to love again \
> Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return \
> Oh darling, the seasons are your friend \
> **— _Death by Chocolate_, Sia**

When the world feels like it is about to collapse because you're heartbroken, it won't really. You can learn to pick up the pieces, no matter how hard it is. But then again, this was said by Sia, so I won't spend too much time explaining. You can't expect me to ever oppose something stated by Sia.

### 11. Don't see situations in mere black and white

> And I guess we fell apart in the usual way \
> And the story's got dust on every page \
> But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now \
> And I see your face in every crowd \
> 'Cause darling, it was good \
> Never looking down \
> And right there where we stood \
> Was holy ground \
> **— _Holy Ground_, Taylor Swift**

When we get out of certain circumstances, we tend to create a picture of them that's either great or terrible. But even in bad situations, there are always lessons to be learned.

### 12. You can't win easily — and if you do, that's an exception

> But if you're ever gonna find a silver lining \
> It's gotta be a cloudy day \
> **— _Silver Lining_, Kacey Musgraves**

There are days when things don't go our way, which can honestly feel like the end of the world. There's a lot of fighting and losing involved in getting to your moment of glory, but it's completely worth it, I promise.

### 13. Be grateful

> Taken for granted, almost everything that I would have died for \
> Just yesterday \
> **— _Looking Up_, Paramore**

Maybe you've been born in an environment of privilege. Or maybe after all the struggle to get where you wanted, you forgot all it took. Either way, keep your eyes open to the reasons to be grateful for what you have. There are more than a few, even if you can't see it when it gets tough.

### 14. Don't be scared of being open

> If the only other option's letting go \
> I'll stay vulnerable \
> **— _Vulnerable_, Selena Gomez**

One of the things that could top my list of "most difficult things to do" is to allow myself to be vulnerable. Putting an effort into hiding your struggles from the people who love you isn't going to make you stronger, just make you seem invincible though you're not.

### 15. Sincerity is scary, especially being honest with yourself

> The truth runs wild \
> Like a tear down a cheek \
> **— _HEAVEN_, Troye Sivan**

The lyrics for _HEAVEN_ feel like a warm hug after so much time questioning and sabotaging feelings. It's so confusing when you feel alone and when you don't know who to turn to, or how to find comfort in your skin. But just as a tear runs down a cheek, the truth can't be held back once it decides to be let out. And just like that, the relief eventually finds its way.

### 16. Respect individuality and embrace your own

> I've had enough, enough, enough \
> And this is my prayer, I swear \
> I'm as free as my hair \
> I am my hair \
> **— _Hair_, Lady Gaga**

Each person finds their way of expressing themselves and it's hurtful to see them being reproached because of that. It shouldn't be hard to accept our differences and be there for each other, right?

### 17. You (should) never stop improving

> I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change \
> I wanna get better, better, better, better \
> **— _I Wanna Get Better_, Bleachers**

Even when everything is going your way, you can't get stuck in a place of conformity. Challenge yourself, healthily and thoughtfully, to be better than you were before. It shouldn't be a competition but a desire to keep learning, because if you're open to, you'll never stop.

### 18. Maturity doesn't come naturally with aging

> We can talk it so good \
> We can make it so divine \
> We can talk it good \
> How you wish it would be all the time \
> And I've never felt more alone \
> It feels so scary, getting old \
> **— _Ribs_, Lorde**

Getting older does not give you the answers in the world. It's increasingly finding new doubts and trying to cope with knowing you'll probably spend your whole life trying to find the answers. Just as you dive into your newfound freedom, you need to be cautious not to drown in your responsibilities.

### 19. Stay true to yourself

> Sometimes I wish that I could change \
> But not for me, for you \
> So we could be together forever \
> But I know, I know that I won't change for you \
> 'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone? \
> When I needed someone \
> When I needed you \
> **— _When I Needed You_, Carly Rae Jepsen**

As someone happy in feeling useful, it's sad to acknowledge not everyone will be willing to do the same thing. The biggest lesson you can take out of that is: don't change yourself just to fit other people's expectations, because that is very prone to lead to disappointments.

### 20. Focus on what matters

> Choose your battles, babe \
> Then you'll win the war \
> **— _Choose Your Battles_, Katy Perry**

In the era of digital "cancelation", shouldn't we agree to fight for the more pressing causes? It's saddening to see someone being completely shamed for a single mistake when all that effort could be put into trying to change the minds of people who are not actively trying to be better.

### 21. Have faith in your work and yourself

> You'll never know until you try it \
> And you don't have to keep it quiet \
> And I know it makes you nervous \
> But I promise you, it's worth it \
> To show 'em everything you kept inside \
> Don't hide, don't hide \
> **— _come out and play_, Billie Eilish**

I didn't think a lot about Billie's words when I first listened to this song, but the message felt clearer with time. The thing is, if you don't put yourself out there, you'll never have the chance to improve. It's scary to let people in your world, but if you don't, you'll never know. Your art is worthy of being seen by others.
