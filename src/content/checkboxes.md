I went through the years "milestoning" each age as if something magical would happen and change everything. Ever since I started writing, I wanted to create something to sum up my whole year in some way. At 18, I wrote that I wouldn't act my age, but I was still far from the truth. At 19, I wrote about meeting someone to make me feel complete, but I ended up learning I needed to know myself better instead.

Past these experiences, at 20, I wrote about the in-between. I wrote about how it's hard to practice the "I won't act my age" maxim when there's a lot of pressure from society that you internalize, and that the feeling of completeness doesn't come from other people except yourself (which is another maxim in itself). And as much as the overthinker in me would like to say this is my ultimate perspective on life, I'm in love with the fact that I'm probably wrong.

It came out all at once, September 6th.
