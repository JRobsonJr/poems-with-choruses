Do you know the feeling of when you learn a new word and suddenly everybody starts using it?

I've wondered in the past about how these things also happen with relationships, like when I didn't know a person before but they appear once and won't stop showing up. Maybe it shows that I'm not paying enough attention to my surroundings, but if not, maybe there's a reason for the continued encounters.

I don't know if I believe in fate at all, but sometimes I feel like it seeks my faith.
