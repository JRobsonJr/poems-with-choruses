> I'm holding the tickets from the last day \
> And I shouldn't, I promised I wouldn't regret \
> We were stretching, nothing in the long run \
> But I wasn't miserable, still looking up \
> I'm reading the letters written back then \
> A list of promises I still want to maintain \
> An old title for a catalog of love songs \
> Eternally a draft of finding where I belonged
>
> **And I may not want you like that \
> But I need you back, I need you back \
> Maybe that was as close as we were supposed to get \
> And I won't regret, but I won't forget \
> Maybe we were too close, I just want a little bit of that \
> I need you back, I need you back**
>
> One step back, still watching closely \
> Seeing my influence slowly turning into your past \
> As you look forward, I'm not there anymore \
> And it's no longer any of my business \
> I took a faster trip to recovery, I know \
> It's healthier we both learn to let go \
> But I can't help it

> And if I had the choice, I wouldn't undo it \
> I can't neglect all the things I've learned \
> We were both committed from start to finish \
> Now I'm just waiting for a new beginning \
> I'll be waiting, and any time, any minute \
> You'll take your time, but you'll come back
