Here's a well-known mantra: love yourself before you love someone else. Simple words, right? But it's hard to love someone who sabotages all your real moments. The person who can't focus on losing the extra weight. The one that doesn't believe you're ever worthy of being loved.

So I need to "rehearse and repeat it," as taught by Dua Lipa, or "fake it until you make it," the words in the mindset of everyone who aims to build confidence from nothing.

Rephrasing and adding my twist, maybe I facilitate some people's way to my feelings. Therefore, when I need to find recovery, I have to decide to revoke this access.

> The thing I'm trying to get into my head \
> It's been discussed before \

> I drove myself crazy again \
> Craving someone's touch \
> I sabotaged a good moment \
> Letting bitter nothings in my ear \
> Disconnect me from the conversation \
> I'm watching my back all night \
> Stuck in a feeling that won't disappear

> The thing I'm trying to get into my head \
> To make up for the lost time \
> Sometimes I'd rather have him, even if he'd rather leave

> Still, the alternate path I face \
