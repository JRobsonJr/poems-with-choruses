Writing "quarantine diaries" wasn't anything I had planned. I didn't even intend to share any content in this blog at all because I'm in a low creative energy mood, at least for writing. This might be the only post in a long time, but who knows. It's not like I'm a regular poster anyway.

Here's a bit of wordplay with a title I've been saving for a long time.

> **_Solitaire_**
>
> I felt the first breeze on my face \
> Air conditioner \
> Oh, I haven't been out for \
> What? Five days, I think \
> And I'm not freaking out yet \
> Been keeping it busy \
> Not alone, but still sad \
> And you're not helping
>
> **"Let's play a card game" \
> You left me hanging \
> What did you think I was planning? \
> You never showed up \
> So now I'm playing solitaire \
> I've been but patient until my limit \
> I swear this was the last time \
> I'm playing solitaire \
> Solitaire, solitaire alone**
>
> I felt the warm wind of change \
> Rainy season \
> People are scared to be out \
> So we haven't been for \
> What? Ten days, wild guess \
> And I've made up my mind \
> That if I'm always working \
> I won't be thinking \
> But there you are \
> When I was about to forget \
> I'm helping you \
> But you're not helping
>
> **"Let's play a card game" \
> You left me hanging \

> I've been but patient until my limit \
> I swear this was the last time \
> I'm playing solitaire \
> Solitaire, solitaire alone**
>
> I felt the need to stop messaging \
> Bitter follow-ups \
> People are back on the streets \
> And they shouldn't, but it's been \
> What? A whole month \
> And who am I kidding? \
> Sweet-talk me into believing \
> And watch me back to the beginning \
> It was so rare to see you calling \
> So I'm not answering \
> (In the same minute) \
> I'll keep you waiting \
> (One, two, three...) \
> "Sorry, I didn't see it" \
> (My eyes never lifted)
