> **_Now We're Talking_**
>
> Yeah, now we're talking! \
> That's just about right \
> As we dive into this looped beat \
> You're sure to come alive
>
> Yeah, now we're talking! \
> We move our worries into the night \
> Forget that maybe there’s a tomorrow \
> As soon as it dropped I finally felt alive
>
> Party nonstop, party nonsense \
> And it’s meaning less each time \
> You try to close your eyes \
> And make sense of the upbeats \
> It’s somewhat late to try it \
> Once the lows have passed you by
>
> But now we're not talking \
> You're away most of the night \
> Can't put together one and one \
> To tell who owned the knife
>
> Daydreams, hopes of silence \
> Synthesizers bringing it up \
> Buried treasures being dug \
> Fool’s gold, meaningless dirt
>
> I could have sought the truth before \
> I stabbed these feelings outright \
> But as soon as the beat dropped \
> For a moment, I felt eternally alive
