Today is Children's Day in Brazil and once again I'm not home for the occasion. I think it means a lot transition-wise for me, considering the whole symbolism of living alone and away from my family.

Anyway, today is not supposed to be a sad moment — it's a day to reflect on the many good memories from other October 12's. It reminds me to be grateful for everything I have and for every battle that has shaped me.

I think "Home, Home" sums a lot of the reflections that this day calls for. I wrote this one out of the nostalgia [Home](https://open.spotify.com/track/6eQ3H5tlCt8EkAXH6Tk0Ez?si=TtyRAq7CRVOaSQh3uFdb4A) from the Undertale soundtrack evokes on me. Thank you, Toby. I don't ever want to forget this feeling, even if it lasts only for a moment.

>How did I overlook it through the years? \
>Draw me near, draw me near, draw me \
>Lure me to the grounds, to the treetops \
>The sky’s just never been more like it \
>The wind makes a gentle mess in my head \
>To say I’m determined is an understatement \
>Maybe I’m determination itself \

>I can’t predict if it will last \
>Maybe soon we’ll call it past \
>But for now, while I lay all weapons down \

>It’s a shame to realize I’m not here often \
>To see there’s glory in simplicity \
>Like waking up to the morning sun \
>I lost track of when I started to live this way \
>Like I don’t know a spare second \
>But who knows when I’ll have a second chance \

>If I close my eyes long enough \
>I can hear you singing me to sleep \
>When you thought I was too young \
>I can’t tell if I’ve really grown since then \
>Don’t let me go away on my own, not yet \
>I’m not ready, I’ve never thought I ever was \
>I don’t really know anything but that I’m here \
