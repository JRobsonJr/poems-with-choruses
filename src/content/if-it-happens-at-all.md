I never imagined the most embarrassing moment of my year would be reading a poem out loud because up to that moment, I never thought of releasing them to the world just yet.

But as I was shaking nervously when I decided I'd do it, I realized that I wasn't afraid of mispronouncing anything, nor of a grammatical error being pointed out. I was only feeling like that because I cared. And I decided that I couldn't be blamed for having feelings for someone and even less for getting in touch with my feelings for the first time in a long time.

I like thinking that if someone released this as an actual song, it'd have been my most played song of the semester.

> **_If It Happens At All_**
>
> Caught myself thinking about you last night \
> At typical songwriter hour \
> Wondering when was the last time I crossed your mind \
> Just like this, unexpectedly \
> If it happens at all
>
> Caught myself trying to decode your thoughts \
> Though you never open up to me \
> Wouldn’t believe that I keep your attention \
> Here’s to still hoping a bit \
> If it matters at all
>
> **Does it ever? \
> Does it ever happen at all? \
> And does it matter? \
> Does it even matter at all?**
>
> There’s something in simple daily living around you \
> Secretly making our paths collide \
> I’ll find a reason to bother you through the day \
> Twisting fate, making it all mine
>
> Have you ever smiled at just the thought of me? \
> It happens to me all the time \
> I try to see so much further than what meets the eye \
> Deluding myself to sleep at night
>
> **Does it ever? \
> Does it ever happen at all? \
> And does it matter? \
> Does it even matter at all?**
>
> When the resources run dry \
> And I can’t compete with your daydreams \
> A concrete answer might hurt more \
> So I’ll stick to maybe, it’s the best I can get \
> At least I don’t get to really ask \
> Let’s keep it like that \
> Unless...
