After a long process of overthinking, worrying and postponing, I finally decided to begin this blog.
With an ever-growing interest in music and all processes around it, I was tempted to try my hand at songwriting over two years ago. My previous attempts in poetry had never made me satisfied, but with time I built a little more confidence. This feeling of "how did I even think of that?" became one of my most valued sensations in the world.

The thing is, songwriting became a coping mechanism for most of my day-to-day problems and struggles. I found myself so caught up in the routine that I figured I needed to spend some time focusing on how I'm feeling. Instead of looking for someone else for therapy, I found my way of getting in touch with my emotions. Yes, it usually gets a little cliche and cringy, and I'm sorry about that.

In this whole process, I have continuously revisited everything I wrote and would never stop "improving" the tiniest details. I needed to find a way to stick to a version of my ideas and this blog is my attempt to put an end to this perfectionist approach.

In short, here I begin to do what we're always recommended not to do: I'll let all my insecurities exposed for anyone on the Internet to read them. Writing letters and poems can be quite therapeutical, but inevitably lead to nothing if I don't come forward to send them to their appropriate recipients. Well, at least I'll know that people could find them if they wanted to.

These are my lyrics that most of the time don't come to me alongside convincing melodies, hence the blog title. These are my **poems with choruses**.
