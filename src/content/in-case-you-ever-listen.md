I've tried many approaches when it comes to writing, but one method that I love is coming up with a title first.

And titles come out of nowhere. For instance, I held onto the idea of a two-part song with similar messages, but different approaches (something on the lines of Lorde's **Hard Feelings / Loveless**).

As much as I loved the first thought, the second half was way easier to write. Revisiting the title, I noticed that time and circumstances helped resignify the message that the title meant to me. So here it is, the Hard Feelings part or so to say, that I finished quite recently.

Here it is for you, in hopes that one day you'll listen, even with distasteful choices or disgraceful weather.

> There’s a delay in my articulating process \
> I could never write straight in pen \
> Liquid paper can’t compete with the eraser \
> And I can’t compete with perfectionism \
> This constant fear of finding better wordings \
> Rewriting to the point the first draft’s forgotten

> I’d throw my planner away \
> In case you ever listen \
> I had many plans for today

> Rest a bit \
> Share the view \
> See the best in me, as I see it all the time in you**

> We’re running out of time \
> No use trying to make some more \
> By complaining about tight schedules \
> Let’s go out for a walk, just me and you \
> Bus on the way home sees me all smiles \
> And you’ll forget most details of the day \
> So will I, but the overall tune will still play \
> Happier than I’ve been thanks to you

> **Save your seat \
> Sip from my coffee \
> The weather is disgraceful, but even that would do \
> Mock your name \
> Draws at every game \
> Find the best in me, I’ll tell what I like the best in you**

> You took a minute longer to return \
> Did you find someone on the way? \
> You could even be already seeing someone \
> You see, my mind goes as far as that \
> And it doesn't get back as soon as you do \
> And who'd be to blame to see it in you? \
> Instead of telling the truth, an invitation just to

> All that I do is collect words for a single poem \
> Shame it's the one you wouldn’t listen to \
> My voice is torture going on for a minute too long \
> You’d pity the layers of reverb on my lament \
> I pity the wasted tears on your opinions

> What if you hadn’t skipped by now? \
