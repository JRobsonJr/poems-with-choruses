On the third day of the year, I looked out of a taxi window and stared at the street lights on what seemed to be a few hours long ride. I was hopeful that I could be a little closer to a lifelong dream, and thinking about how so many people lead the everyday life I so long hoped for, but they took it for granted.

Now, with everything that's going on, even dreaming of it sometimes feels like a stretch. "Simpler" goals and things that **I** took for granted seem so much more desirable: to be able to go outside without fearing the worse for everyone around me, to be able to see my friends, to wake up early in the morning, to wait half an hour for the next bus. Now, I'm well aware that the streets I always walked through are easily New York streets for other people â€” these days, even for me.

And this might not look like it, but it's still a love song. A love song dedicated to dreaming, a love song dedicated to the friends I want to share it with. A love song for getting back on the streets as soon as possible and keep working to achieve the dream.
