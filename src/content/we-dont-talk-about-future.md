"Where do you see yourself in ten years?" is the kind of question that gives me serious goosebumps. I hate to be reminded that everything will keep changing, and they will in the months to come.

However, the past is also tough to face if you're not confident in your choices. Perhaps you'd rather pretend you've forgotten the bitter parts to move forward with a clear mind, but they still happened (and they will make sure you remember they happened).

This one is for the moments of anxiety that strike back and forth. It's pretty much the same from when I wrote in my head as I walked up the stairs to the apartment, wishing that I could be [writing the future out loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oScRBsOV6I) instead.
