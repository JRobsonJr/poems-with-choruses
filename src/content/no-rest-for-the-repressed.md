This is a love story.

> **_No Rest For The Repressed_**
>
> I named a price for my silence \
> And I set up the whole auction \
> I sold it off at the cheapest deal I could get \
> What a burden to put on a kid \
> Too young to stand on both feet \
> And know that he shouldn't settle for any value
>
> **'Cause I always had a hunch \
> But I always called it off \
> Thought that I could change the world \
> Changing myself was the cost**
>
> Barbed wire covered each mean word \
> Ever heard in dining tables \
> Though hurtful, time and I made it into flowers \
> Offerings for anyone in need \
> Favors I'd never ask back \
> The favored side felt as far as I felt like a coward \
> I was drowning, crying their fears \
> Truths I still find hard to confess \
> But all I needed was someone to cry for me
>
> **'Cause I always had a hunch \
> But I always called it off \
> Thought that I could change the world \
> Changing myself was the cost**
>
> Slowly saving up, getting older \
> And though he wouldn't believe me \
> Even the ever-brokenhearted boy found his peace \
> That day heard the longest sigh \
> Ever recorded in human life \
> And those who lent their ears asking themselves why
>
> Why wait for so long when you know \
> There's no rest for the repressed \
> Neither pride in running away
>
> **'Cause I always had a hunch \
> But I always called it off \
> Thought that I could change the world \
> Changing myself was the cost \
> And I don't pay it anymore**
>
> What a burden to put on a kid \
> But if I knew you back then \
> Would I ask you to break my heart \
> Just to help me through the worst parts? \
> I named a price for my silence \
> But if you knew me back then \
> Would you be a timely arrival \
> And redeem my words to break the cycle?
