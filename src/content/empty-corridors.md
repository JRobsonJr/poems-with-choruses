Sometimes I can't find a way to write concisely and coherently, but when I run out of ideas, I can always trust my thought flow to write whatever comes to mind and fight writer's block. Sometimes it ends up being the same thing over and over, and sometimes I end up writing a draft for _Empty Corridors_. And the rough draft can linger a lot before it ends up being something I'm proud of, but after a few separate days in time, the result paints a picture of moments in my past that I both cherish and remember painfully.

> **_Empty Corridors_**
>
> Through these empty corridors \
> So many people walk every day \
> Minds heavy with banalities \
> But it's easy to say it was easy \
> You don't remember what it took
>
> **To get where we got \
> This is it, we just forgot**
>
> Stand by the wall, not ready for it to begin \
> The revolution right in front of me \
> â€˜Cause there's a face I've never seen \
> It caught my eye, left a mark on my mind \
> Where have you been all this time?
>
> **I won't ask for your name \
> But I'll find it out all the same**
>
> When we shared classes \
> I didn't tell anyone then \
> Because they wouldn't understand \
> The reasons why I felt this urge \
> To hold your hand \
> The first thing I found out: \
> You actually liked my friend
>
> **I don't get this sudden jealousy \
> All my lies come back at once to me**
>
> I remember the one day I didn't see you \
> It broke our ongoing meeting streak \
> Frustration from you calling me needy \
> Frustration when I realized I was counting
>
> **Then it was clear, the fog was all gone \
> But I needed to find the courage to carry on**
>
> Alone, trying to figure out what this is \
> To maybe hope there'll come the point \
> I'll bring you up to speed \
> I'm always waiting for the next big thing \
> Once I get sick of the last one \
> But back and forth, you've been a constant
>
> **Then I had a clear view of what had to be done \
> But I needed to find the courage to carry on**
