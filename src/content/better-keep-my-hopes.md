I've read a lot about how repetition is a magic element in songwriting, but it's hard to tell if you're overdoing it. Trying to diversify what I'm writing, I end up getting stuck with a lot of wordy pieces that wouldn't fit a melody if I begged them.

I wanted to write something just to convey a feeling, so I didn't overthink it. I love it for the title that seems to lead you somewhere, but in the end, it goes to the absolute opposite. It's all about lowering your expectations given changes in situations â€” slowly realizing you stopped hoping to be loved. Finding solace in just knowing you're not invisible.

When I was writing it, I always felt like it needed a bridge. Reading some random thoughts of a few months earlier, I placed them right there and didn't feel like I needed to change anything.

> You said you're heavy \
> But I'm no lighter \
> Can't ease your pains \
> Forgotten laughter \
> I'm not that good \
> Not that bad, either \
> I have much to say \
> Things that matter
>
> I unload my feelings \
> Let them out slowly \
> I bestow upon you \
> So I won't explode

> **And every time I'll \
> Hope you love it \
> Hope you like it \
> Hope you take it \
> Hope you bear it \
> Hope you hear it \
> Better keep my hopes down**

> You can't see me \
> From where you're looking \
> Emulate your cool \
> But I'm still hurting \
> I strayed too far off \
> You didn't notice \
> And you don't hide \
> I know you heard it
>
> Reloaded with feelings \
> Packed them up slowly \
> Afraid that I'll explode \
> More than I can hold

> **And every time I'll \
> Hope you love it \
> Hope you like it \
> Hope you take it \
> Hope you bear it \
> Hope you hear it \
> Better keep my hopes down**

> Hellish ticks \
> Give up \
> Crying at night \
> Enough \
> Baby steps \
> Crawling back \
> Torn paper \
> Worn out dreams
>
> **And every time I'll \
> Hope you love me \
> Hope you trust me \
> Hope you like me, no \
> Hope you bear me \
> Hope you see me \
> Better keep my hopes down**

> Better keep my hopes down \
> Better keep my hopes down \
> Better keep my hopes down \
> Better keep my hopes
