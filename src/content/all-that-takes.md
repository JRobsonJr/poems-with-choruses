> **_All That Takes_**
>
> Lately, I've been visiting places I can't afford to go \
> And I've been turning myself to people I think I'll never know \
> From the moment you were no longer a stranger \
> Something more upbeat has me turning up the radio \
> I've learnt to count my blessings in the lyrics of a song \
> Every time I put myself down, you say that I'm wrong
>
> **All that takes is one song \
> I feel like I already know you \
> All that takes is one song \
> And you said you loved it too \
> All that takes is one song \
> These nights, I don't ever feel alone \
> All that takes is you \
> To make me want one more song**
>
> Lately, I've been leaving the lights on, screens keep me long awake \
> And I've been looking for signs in records to help me understand \
> Can you feel it too or it's just me acting like a fool? \
> I wonder if I knew love before I found this \
> Searching for a sense in new doubts and then you freed me \
> From the little things that tricked me one time and again
>

> This is one more song and it finds me facing the truth \
> I didn't have all the words, so I hid in one or two \
> But now that I know, hear me tell you how I'm feeling \
> Lately, I've been wanting you not to log off so soon \
> As it gets late, soon we'll be facing reality \
> But let us make our every second everlasting \
> And that's why I wrote you this song \
> To keep this moment forever \
> And if I want to play it back \
> I'll feel that you're coming along

> All that takes is one song \
> That you read and you didn't have a clue \
> All that takes is one song \
> And I'll believe you're coming along \
> All that takes is you \
> To make me write one more song
